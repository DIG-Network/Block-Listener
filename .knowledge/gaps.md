# Implementation Gaps

## Block Structure Parsing ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `crate/chia-generator-parser/src/parser.rs`
- **Status**: Fully implemented using chia-protocol types
- **What's Done**: 
  - Direct usage of `chia_protocol::FullBlock` ✅
  - Height extraction from reward_chain_block ✅
  - Weight extraction from reward_chain_block ✅
  - Timestamp extraction from foliage_transaction_block ✅
  - Header hash computation using SHA256 ✅
  - Reward claims extraction from transactions_info ✅
  - Generator extraction from block ✅
  - All fields properly mapped from chia-protocol types ✅

## Generator Execution ❌ CRITICAL - NOT PRODUCTION READY
- **Location**: `crate/chia-generator-parser/src/parser.rs:105-132`
- **Issue**: Uses placeholder pattern matching instead of proper CLVM execution
- **Triple-Checked Against Python**: Confirmed missing run_block_generator2
- **Required**: Must implement `chia_rs::run_block_generator2` to:
  - Execute generators with block references
  - Handle max cost limits
  - Extract SpendBundleConditions
  - Process conditions for coin additions/removals
  - Get puzzle reveals and solutions

## Coin Extraction ❌ NO REAL DATA
- **Current**: Returns empty vectors for all coins
- **Missing**:
  - Coin removals (spent coins)
  - Coin additions (created coins)
  - Coin spends with puzzle/solution
  - Condition processing
- **Impact**: Cannot track any blockchain state changes

## Generator References ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Block references ignored in process_generator_for_coins
- **Required**: Need to fetch and pass previous generators for compressed blocks
- **Impact**: Cannot process blocks that reference previous generators

## Header Block Creation ⚠️ MINOR
- **Location**: header_block_from_block (removed in refactor)
- **Issue**: Function was placeholder, now removed
- **Impact**: Minor - not critical for coin extraction

## CLVM Execution Details ❌ MISSING
- **run_block_generator2**: Not imported or used
- **Block References**: Not fetched or passed
- **Cost Calculation**: Not implemented
- **Condition Parsing**: Not implemented
- **CREATE_COIN Processing**: Pattern matching instead of execution

## Production Readiness Summary
**NOT READY** - Will fail to extract coins from real blocks:
1. ❌ No generator execution
2. ❌ No coin extraction
3. ❌ No condition processing
4. ❌ No compressed block support

## Improvements Made ✅
1. **Eliminated manual byte parsing** - using chia-protocol types directly
2. **Type-safe implementation** - leveraging Rust's type system
3. **Proper dependency versions** - all aligned to 0.26.0
4. **Cleaner architecture** - no redundant serialization/deserialization
