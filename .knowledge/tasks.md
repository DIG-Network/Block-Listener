## Next Tasks 📋
1. **Add chia_rs dependency** with proper version
2. **Import run_block_generator2** from chia_rs
3. **Implement process_generator_for_coins** properly:
   - Fetch block references
   - Calculate max cost
   - Execute generator
   - Extract SpendBundleConditions
4. **Process conditions** to extract coins:
   - Coin removals from spends
   - Coin additions from CREATE_COIN
   - Puzzle reveals and solutions
5. **Test with real blocks** containing transactions
6. **Optimize performance** if needed

## Known Issues 🐛
- Generator execution not implemented
- No real coin extraction
- Block references ignored
- No condition processing

## Architecture Notes 📝
- Now using chia-protocol types directly
- No more manual byte parsing
- Type-safe implementation
- All dependencies aligned to 0.26.0
