## Current ðŸ”„
- ðŸ”„ None

## Pending ðŸ“‹
- ðŸ“‹ Integrate chia-consensus run_block_generator2 for full CLVM execution (blocked by module visibility)
- ðŸ“‹ Handle compressed block references that use previous generators
- ðŸ“‹ Extract CREATE_COIN conditions from generator execution
- ðŸ“‹ Resolve chia-consensus module path issues

## Critical Issues ðŸš¨
- ðŸš¨ chia-consensus gen module not publicly exposed - blocking full generator execution
- ðŸš¨ Pattern matching misses CREATE_COIN conditions - incomplete coin data
